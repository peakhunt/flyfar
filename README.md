Have you ever seen the tiny aircraft side game of Town Ship?
I was so inspired by the tiny game and decided to make my own. Here we go!

## regarding game assets
I don't claim any kind of rights on game assets (images and sounds) used in this game.
I just downloaded them from the internet and used them for my experimental game.
This game won't never make it into a commercial status!

## current status

Found some chopper sprites and finally it looks like flying.

# previously when I just got started
still work in progress and I ain't gonna rush! Game programming is always a good hobby!
1. Currently parallax scrolling works.
2. You can move the camera up and down using UP/DOWN keyboard.
