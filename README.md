Have you ever seen the tiny aircraft sidegame of Town Ship?
I was so inspired by the tiny game and decided to make my own and here we go!

## regarding game assets
I don't claim any kind of rights on game assets (images and sounds) used in this game.
I just downloaded them from the internet and used them for my experimental game.
This game won't never make it into a commercial status!

## current status
still work in progress and I ain't gonna rush!
1. Currently parallax scrolling works.
2. You can move the camera up and down using UP/DOWN keyboard.
